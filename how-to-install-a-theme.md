# How to install a Sublime Text theme (the easy way)

The easiest way to install a new theme is via the [Colorsublime](https://github.com/Colorsublime/Colorsublime-Plugin) plugin.
A huge thanks to [blopker](http://blopker.com) for his awesome contribution!

Just search for 'Colorsublime' in [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) and install the plugin. That's all!

# How to install a Sublime Text theme (the hard way)

Installing a Colorsublime theme on Sublime Text 2/3 is really simple.
Please make sure to execute correctly all the following steps:

1.  Open Sublime text and click on
    **Preferences -> Browse Packages** ![](/assets/img/browse-package.png)
2.  Once you are inside the Sublime Text folder called **"Packages"** create a new folder naming it **"Colorsublime-Themes"**
3.  Then put the file/files **.tmTheme** just downloaded from our website inside the **"Colorsublime-Themes"** folder
4.  Cool! Now you should be able to select your custom themes by browsing
    **Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Colorsublime-Themes** ![](/assets/img/Colorsublime-Themes.png)
